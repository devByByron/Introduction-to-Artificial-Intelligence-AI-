## ‚úçÔ∏è Key Learnings & Notes

## AI

**What is AI?**
AI clones human intelligence through computer systems. They utilize alogorithms and data to function. Enable machines to perform task requiring human intelligence such as: Learning, Reasoning Problem-solving and Decision-making

**Types of AI**
- Weak AI (narrow AI): AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).
- Strong AI (generalized AI): AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.
- Super AI (conscious AI): A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything or even replace a human.

**Additional AI Types**:

- **Descriptive AI** explains what happened by looking at past data.
Example: A customer service dashboard showing why customers canceled subscriptions by analyzing past complaints and usage data.

- **Predictive AI** guesses what might happen in the future.
Example: Netflix recommendations guessing what you might want to watch next based on your viewing history.

- **Prescriptive AI** suggests what actions to take.
Example: Google Maps recommending the fastest route to avoid traffic.

- **Generative AI (Strong AI)** creates things like text, images, or code.
Example: ChatGPT writing emails or articles.

- **Reactive AI** gives fixed responses to certain inputs.
Example: Chess-playing AIs like IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue that make moves based on current board setup, without learning from past games.

- **Limited Memory AI** learns from past experiences to make better decisions.
Example: Self-driving cars that remember recent traffic patterns to avoid hazards.

- **Theory of Mind AI (future goal)** aims to understand human feelings and thoughts.
Example: A future robot therapist that can sense when someone is sad or lying and adjust its response.

- **Self-Aware AI (not yet real)** would have its own thoughts and consciousness.
Example: A robot that knows it‚Äôs a robot, has its own thoughts, and can make independent decisions‚Äîlike a character from a sci-fi movie (e.g., Ava from Ex Machina).

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** does one specific job well.
Example: Siri or Alexa answering questions and setting reminders.

- **General AI** would be able to think and learn like a human across many tasks.
Example: A robot teacher that can teach math today and cook a meal tomorrow‚Äîjust like a human can learn and adapt to new tasks.

**How does AI learn?**
**Supervised learning:**
- The algorithm learns from labeled data (where the correct answers are already known).
- It‚Äôs like learning with a teacher who tells you the right answer.
- Used for classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
- The more examples it sees, the better it gets.
  
**Unsupervised learning:**
- The algorithm works with data that has no labels‚Äîit has to figure things out on its own.
- It looks for patterns, trends, or groups in the data.
- Useful for clustering (e.g., grouping customers by behavior) or dimensionality reduction (simplifying data).
  
Reinforcement learning:

**Human, Artifical and Augmented Intelligence**

**Human intelligence**: Needed for basic driving tasks like steering and looking in mirrors.

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**: Lets cars drive themselves by controlling speed and distance without help from humans.

**Strengths of machines vs. humans**:

- Machines are great at quickly handling lots of data and doing repetitive jobs accurately.

- Humans are better at being creative, understanding emotions, and using general knowledge‚Äîimportant for things like customer service.

**Augmented intelligence**: Combines human skills with machine help. Makes people more capable and helps with tasks that are hard to do alone. It improves safety and productivity by working alongside humans.

**Generative AI**

**What is Generative AI?**
It creates brand-new content (like text, pictures, music, videos) instead of just analyzing data and making decisions like regular AI.

**How does it work?**
It uses deep learning and big collections of data to make different types of content.

**What can it do?**
It can understand and create language (like writing or translating) using big language models (LLMs).
It helps make marketing, creative work, product design, healthcare, gaming, fashion, and education better.

**Why does it matter?**
It is changing many industries by helping people work faster, come up with new ideas, and make custom solutions.
Experts think it will help the world‚Äôs economy grow a lot in the next 10 years.

**Traditional AI vs Generative AI**

**Traditional AI:**
- Uses internal data like tables, images, and documents.

**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**

Introduction to RAG
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid NLP approach combining retrieval-based and generation-based models.

Effective for question answering, dialogue systems, and content creation.

Objectives
Understand how RAG works.

Learn how it overcomes generative AI limitations.

Explore its applications and use cases.

How RAG Works (3 Steps)
Retrieve: Relevant documents or data are fetched from a corpus or database.

Augment: Retrieved documents are added to the query as extra context.

Generate: The generative model produces a response using both the query and retrieved data.

Limitations of Pure Generative AI
Can hallucinate (produce plausible but false information).

Knowledge cutoff‚Äîcannot access information beyond training date.

Limited context window, struggling with long-term context.

May lack depth and specificity.

Computationally expensive for long/complex tasks.

How RAG Addresses These Limitations
Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in retrieved data.

Mitigates knowledge cutoff via up-to-date retrieval.

Extends context window by including relevant documents.

Improves specificity with detailed and focused information.

Increases efficiency by narrowing information space before generation.

Key Components
1. Retrieval Component

Function: Finds relevant, factual information from a corpus.

Mechanism: Uses methods like BM25 or neural dense retrievers.

2. Generation Component

Function: Produces coherent, context-aware text.

Mechanism: Uses models like GPT-3 or BERT, blending retrieved data with generative power.

Benefits
More accurate and factually grounded outputs.

Contextually relevant responses.

Adaptable to many NLP tasks.

Provides real-time, updated information.

Applications
Question answering (complex queries).

Content creation (articles, reports, creative writing).

Customer support (accurate and updated responses).

Search engines (better, fact-based results).

RAG on Google Cloud
Vertex AI: Build and deploy RAG models.

BigQuery: Efficiently retrieve large datasets.

Key features: Scalability, integration with APIs/data sources, customization options.

Example
For ‚ÄúWhat were the key causes of World War II?‚Äù, RAG retrieves relevant historical documents, then generates an accurate, detailed answer.
