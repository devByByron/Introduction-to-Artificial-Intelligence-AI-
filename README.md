## ‚úçÔ∏è Key Learnings & Notes

## AI

**What is AI?**
AI clones human intelligence through computer systems. They utilize alogorithms and data to function. Enable machines to perform task requiring human intelligence such as: Learning, Reasoning Problem-solving and Decision-making

**Types of AI**
- Weak AI (narrow AI): AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).
- Strong AI (generalized AI): AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.
- Super AI (conscious AI): A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything or even replace a human.

**Additional AI Types**:

- **Descriptive AI** explains what happened by looking at past data.
Example: A customer service dashboard showing why customers canceled subscriptions by analyzing past complaints and usage data.

- **Predictive AI** guesses what might happen in the future.
Example: Netflix recommendations guessing what you might want to watch next based on your viewing history.

- **Prescriptive AI** suggests what actions to take.
Example: Google Maps recommending the fastest route to avoid traffic.

- **Generative AI (Strong AI)** creates things like text, images, or code.
Example: ChatGPT writing emails or articles.

- **Reactive AI** gives fixed responses to certain inputs.
Example: Chess-playing AIs like IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue that make moves based on current board setup, without learning from past games.

- **Limited Memory AI** learns from past experiences to make better decisions.
Example: Self-driving cars that remember recent traffic patterns to avoid hazards.

- **Theory of Mind AI (future goal)** aims to understand human feelings and thoughts.
Example: A future robot therapist that can sense when someone is sad or lying and adjust its response.

- **Self-Aware AI (not yet real)** would have its own thoughts and consciousness.
Example: A robot that knows it‚Äôs a robot, has its own thoughts, and can make independent decisions‚Äîlike a character from a sci-fi movie (e.g., Ava from Ex Machina).

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** does one specific job well.
Example: Siri or Alexa answering questions and setting reminders.

- **General AI** would be able to think and learn like a human across many tasks.
Example: A robot teacher that can teach math today and cook a meal tomorrow‚Äîjust like a human can learn and adapt to new tasks.

**How does AI learn?**
- Supervised learning:
- Unsupervised learning:
- Reinforcement learning:

**Human, Artifical and Augmented Intelligence**

**Human intelligence**: Needed for basic driving tasks like steering and looking in mirrors.

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**: Lets cars drive themselves by controlling speed and distance without help from humans.

**Strengths of machines vs. humans**:

- Machines are great at quickly handling lots of data and doing repetitive jobs accurately.

- Humans are better at being creative, understanding emotions, and using general knowledge‚Äîimportant for things like customer service.

**Augmented intelligence**: Combines human skills with machine help. Makes people more capable and helps with tasks that are hard to do alone. It improves safety and productivity by working alongside humans.

**Generative AI**

**What is Generative AI?**
It creates brand-new content (like text, pictures, music, videos) instead of just analyzing data and making decisions like regular AI.

**How does it work?**
It uses deep learning and big collections of data to make different types of content.

**What can it do?**
It can understand and create language (like writing or translating) using big language models (LLMs).
It helps make marketing, creative work, product design, healthcare, gaming, fashion, and education better.

**Why does it matter?**
It is changing many industries by helping people work faster, come up with new ideas, and make custom solutions.
Experts think it will help the world‚Äôs economy grow a lot in the next 10 years.

**Traditional AI vs Generative AI**

**Traditional AI:**
- Uses internal data like tables, images, and documents.
- Builds models to make predictions (e.g. prevent customer churn).
- Learns over time using a feedback loop to improve accuracy.

**Generative AI:**
- Uses large external datasets (not just company data).
- Relies on large language models (LLMs) that need careful prompting and tuning.
- A feedback loop helps refine prompts to make responses more specific to a company‚Äôs needs.

**Generative AI Use Cases**
**Text Generation**
Tools like ChatGPT and Google Gemini use large language models (LLMs) like GPT, PaLM, and Gemini to create text.

**Image Generation**
Stable Diffusion and DALL-E are used to generate realistic images.

**Voice and Music Generation**
Tools like Murf and AIVA create music and voice content in different moods and styles.

**Video Generation**
AI models like Google‚Äôs Imagen Video and OpenAI‚Äôs Sora can generate lifelike videos.

**Generative AI Google Uses:**

**Google Photos**: Image enhancements
**Google Duplex**: Natural Language Understanding 
**Google Magenta**: Music Generation

**Generative AI Adobe Uses:**
**Adobe Sensei** - Machine learning platform. Used for photo automation and font recognition.
**Saleforce** - Uses Einstein for its slack platform. Leveraging ChatGPT AI technology.
