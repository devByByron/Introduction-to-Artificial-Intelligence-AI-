## AI

**What is AI?**
AI clones human intelligence through computer systems. They utilize alogorithms and data to function. Enable machines to perform task requiring human intelligence such as: Learning, Reasoning Problem-solving and Decision-making

**Types of AI**
- Weak AI (narrow AI): AI that can do one specific thing really well (one trick pony's).
- Strong AI (generalized AI): AI that can create things, like text, images, or music.
- Super AI (conscious AI): A future type of AI that would be as smart as a human at everything or even replace a human.

**Additional AI Types**:

- **Descriptive AI** explains what happened by looking at past data.
Example: A customer service dashboard showing why customers canceled subscriptions by analyzing past complaints and usage data.

- **Predictive AI** guesses what might happen in the future.
Example: Netflix recommendations guessing what you might want to watch next based on your viewing history.

- **Prescriptive AI** suggests what actions to take.
Example: Google Maps recommending the fastest route to avoid traffic.

- **Generative AI (Strong AI)** creates things like text, images, or code.
Example: ChatGPT writing emails or articles.

- **Reactive AI** gives fixed responses to certain inputs.
Example: Chess-playing AIs like IBM‚Äôs Deep Blue that make moves based on current board setup, without learning from past games.

- **Limited Memory AI** learns from past experiences to make better decisions.
Example: Self-driving cars that remember recent traffic patterns to avoid hazards.

- **Theory of Mind AI (future goal)** aims to understand human feelings and thoughts.
Example: A future robot therapist that can sense when someone is sad or lying and adjust its response.

- **Self-Aware AI (not yet real)** would have its own thoughts and consciousness.
Example: A robot that knows it‚Äôs a robot, has its own thoughts, and can make independent decisions‚Äîlike a character from a sci-fi movie (e.g., Ava from Ex Machina).

- **Narrow AI (Weak AI)** does one specific job well.
Example: Siri or Alexa answering questions and setting reminders.

- **General AI** would be able to think and learn like a human across many tasks.
Example: A robot teacher that can teach math today and cook a meal tomorrow‚Äîjust like a human can learn and adapt to new tasks.

**How does AI learn?**

**Supervised learning:**
- The algorithm learns from labeled data (where the correct answers are already known).
- It‚Äôs like learning with a teacher who tells you the right answer.
- Used for classification (e.g., spam vs. not spam) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices).
- The more examples it sees, the better it gets.
  
**Unsupervised learning:**
- The algorithm works with data that has no labels‚Äîit has to figure things out on its own.
- It looks for patterns, trends, or groups in the data.
- Useful for clustering (e.g., grouping customers by behavior) or dimensionality reduction (simplifying data).
  
Reinforcement learning:

**Human, Artifical and Augmented Intelligence**

**Human intelligence**: Needed for basic driving tasks like steering and looking in mirrors.

**Artificial intelligence (AI)**: Lets cars drive themselves by controlling speed and distance without help from humans.

**Limitations of Pure Generative AI**
- Can hallucinate (produce plausible but false information).
- Knowledge cutoff‚Äîcannot access information beyond training date.
- Limited context window, struggling with long-term context.
- May lack depth and specificity.
- Computationally expensive for long/complex tasks.

**How RAG Addresses These Limitations**
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in retrieved data.
- Mitigates knowledge cutoff via up-to-date retrieval.
- Extends context window by including relevant documents.
- Improves specificity with detailed and focused information.
- Increases efficiency by narrowing information space before generation.

**Key Components**
**1. Retrieval Component**
Function: Finds relevant, factual information from a corpus.
Mechanism: Uses methods like BM25 or neural dense retrievers.

**2. Generation Component**

**Ethical Considerations**

Ethical considerations and responsible use of AI refer to the principles, practices, and guidelines aimed at ensuring that artificial intelligence technologies are developed, deployed, and used in ways that are beneficial, fair, and respectful of human rights and societal values. 

- The ethical considerations of AI include data privacy and security, bias and fairness, transparency and accountability, autonomous systems and human oversight, and access and equality. 

AI can be used responsibly by:

- Using diverse datasets

- Designing fully autonomous systems that include human-in-the-loop mechanisms

- Ensuring AI‚Äôs accessibility and benefits to all segments of society

- Optimizing algorithms for energy efficiency

- Utilizing renewable energy sources for data centers

Generative AI involves the use of algorithms to create new content, such as text, images, audio, and video, presenting unique opportunities and challenges. 

Some considerations around using generative AI are:

- Copyright and ownership: It is important for developers and users to familiarize themselves with legal frameworks and stay updated on evolving laws. 

- Privacy and confidentiality of user data: It is beneficial to use private AI models and a combination of technical and legal measures. 

- Deepfakes and misinformation: It is essential to think critically in ensuring the accuracy of generative AI outputs, and how it can mitigate AI flaws like hallucinations.

- Ethical considerations: It is crucial for developers to prioritize fairness, accountability, and social benefits in AI development.

Examining the perspectives of the key players can help one gain a comprehensive understanding of the diverse approaches to AI ethics, the challenges they aim to address, and the strategies they employ to promote the responsible use of AI technologies.

IBM‚Äôs pillars of trust are central to its approach to ensuring that AI systems are explainable, fair, robust, transparent, and privacy-preserving. 

Microsoft‚Äôs approach to ethical AI involves human-in-the-loop systems, continuous monitoring and improvement, regular audits using the artificial intelligence act (AIA), internal review bodies, and responsible AI standards. 

Google‚Äôs AI principles focus on benefiting society, ensuring fairness and accountability, and upholding high standards of scientific excellence.

Premature deployment and adoption of AI systems could put the companies at a huge risk of reputational and financial loss.

AI governance refers to a set of rules, standards, and processes that have been established to ensure the responsible and ethical development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems.

Risks associated with AI:

**Bias in AI models:**

- Human-generated data can contain hidden biases.

- AI models can pick up and reflect these biases in their outcomes.

**Privacy and copyright infringement:**

- Sensitive data can be inadvertently included in models.

- Unstructured data may contain copyrighted material.

**Lack of transparency:**

- Black box models offer high accuracy but lack explainability.

- Lack of transparency can erode trust in AI systems.

**Model deterioration:**

- AI models require continuous monitoring and updates.

- Incoming data may differ from training data, causing performance degradation.

Continuous monitoring ensures AI models produce consistent, high-quality outcomes and prevents deterioration in model performance over time.

**Organizations worldwide are creating regulations and guidelines for AI.**

- Examples include the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and the EU AI Act.

- Regulations can penalize non-compliant companies, emphasizing the importance of adhering to ethical guidelines.

AI promises significant benefits but also poses real risks.

Proper governance is crucial to fully realize the potential of AI while mitigating associated risks.
